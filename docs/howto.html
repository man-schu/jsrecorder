  <h1>How to use JSRecorder</h1>
<img src="images/jsrec01.png" alt="functionalities">
<p>Press "Record Audio" to record audio only, using the standard microphone.</p>
<p>Press "Record Video" to record video only, using the standard camera.</p>
<p>Press "Record Screen" to record the full screen or windows of your choice.</p>
<p>In order to be able to use this application, you have to enable the corresponding devices.</p>
<p>For instance, to record a video you have to allow camera and microphone:</p>

<p>Once you are finished, press "Stop".</p>
<p>You will be asked to enter a file name:</p>

<p>Press OK.</p>
<p>Now you will be shown a button "Save as webm file".</p>

<p>This will allow you to save the recording as a file.</p>
<p>Note that this application cannot store in a compressed format, as it is fully running on the local machine. 
  The advantage is that there is no privacy issue as there would be if it ran on a server.</p>
